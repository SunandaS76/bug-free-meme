#TIP
Array
- Array is always pass by reference in a function
- For others, vector etc we need to put "&" to it

Time Complexity 
- TC != time taken
- TC for worst case scenario
- Big O notationn
    - Avoid constants
    - Avoid lower value
    - In terms of input size 
    - Cases
        - Best case - BIG O
        - Avg case - Theta
        - Worst case - Omega
    - Single for loop ---> O(N)
    - Nested for loop ---> O(N**2)

Space Complexity
- SC != Space taken
- Space for worst case
- Axuillary space and input space

#TIP
- Never do anything to data, don't manipulate input data unless specified
- Don't tamper data
- If you have to use temp variable then initialize them with some meaningful values

- Online servers - Take 1 s for approx 10**8 operations
